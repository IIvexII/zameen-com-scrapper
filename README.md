# Zameen.com Web Scraper

This is a web scraper built to collect data from Zameen.com, a leading online property portal in Pakistan. The scraper collects detailed information on real estate property listings, such as city, location, price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and size of the property in square feet.

## Download Dataset

I have collected data of 4000+ properties that you can download from [Zameen.com Property Dataset Pakistan 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadzafeer/zameen-com-property-data-pakistan-2023)

## Usage

To use the scraper, simply run the `scraper.py` script or `scraper.ipynb` for Jupyter nootbook. The scraper will generate a CSV file with the collected data, which can be used for a variety of purposes such as market analysis, trend analysis, and investment research.

## Installation

To install the dependencies for the scraper, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
